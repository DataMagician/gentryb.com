title: Who is this Gentry guy anyway?

I'm a human who makes a ton of mistakes (but works hard to learn from each) - making mistakes is how I'm able to learn.  Failures are what I've learned the most from when I look back across my career and life.

I am a constant learner that is heavily motivated by solving challenges in various businesses and projects.  I co-authored Mastering SQL Server 2008 by Sybex/Wiley with Michael Lee.  The thing I enjoy the most about technology is that it's constantly changing (and mostly improving) - and business problems are constantly evolving in complexity. 

# What Motivates Me?

Constant Learning
: If I'm not learning something new, I quickly become bored.  I subscribe to and
  reguarly use [PluralSight](https://pluralsight.com) 

Software Development
: Building and extending software, as well as refactoring legacy codebases are
  another odd hobby of mine.  I have used many languages, but am most proficient
  in C#, Transact-SQL, MDX, PowerShell.  I'm quite interested in various front
  end technologies, like React.js, redux
  
Cloud Technologies
: I'll admit I have the most experience with Azure - but that's mostly because
  Microsoft continues to give me free money every month with my MSDN
  subscriptions (past and present, ironically)j
  
Virtualization / Containerization
: The fact that Xen is used as a base is one of the reasons I love
  [Qubes][qubes-os].  I'm also quite intereted in docker and related
  technologies
  
Application Lifecycle Management & Continuious Integration
: Managing the lifecycle of an application - from feature and work item
  definition, to automated tests, build, and deployment using various toolsets
  
Source Control (mostly git)
: Without source control, I'd be lost.

Operating Systems
: I love working with a wide varity of operating systems, including [Qubes-OS][qubes-os],
  [OpenBSD][openbsd], [FreeBSD][freebsd], Linux ([Arch][arch], [Gentoo][gentoo],
  [Debian][debian]), MacOS, Windows

Music
: Just about every type you can imagine.  Listening and composing

Photography
: Capturing landscapes, portraits, candid, and street photography.  I love
  working with long esposures.
  
Building Systems
: software, automation, continuious integration, application lifecycle management, business intelligence solutions...
    
Security and Reverse Engineering
: I have a tendency to look at ways that a system can be broken or exploited
  that seems to come naturally.  I've run a security practice for a professional
  services organization doing audits, penetration testing, and remediation.
