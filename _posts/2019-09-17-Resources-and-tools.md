There are quite a few tools that I use quite regularly that many other
professionals I've met and worked with have never heard of or tried.  I know
that I won't have a list anywhere near Scott Hanselman's tool lists of old, but
we'll see - perhaps this post will become an ever expanding article one day.

# Tools I use Regularly

Below are the tools that I use on a regular basis.  They are grouped

## Cross-Platform Tools

[emacs][emacs]
: Yes, I'm an emacs guy.  I've even gotten to the point of beginning to fall in
  love with spacemacs (and evil mode).  The thing that initially sucked me into
  emacs was [org-mode][org-mode].
  
    - emacs configurations that influenced me:
      - [norang emacs configuration](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode/)
      
      
    - Packages I find essential
      - magit
      - helm
      - spacemacs
  
[zsh][zsh]
: My shell of choice - even on Windows when it's possible :)

    - oh-my-zsh
    
PlantUML
: An amazing tool for building many types of diagrams using plain text
